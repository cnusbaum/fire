			Arizona&rsquo;s traditional public pension  system is the best way to ensure our state&rsquo;s taxpayers reliably receive vital  services. It is a cost-effective, proven, stable method to attract and retain  qualified first responders.</p>
		
	<p>That said, to fully consider the future  of the public safety pension system, it is imperative to understand the <strong>FACTS </strong>and dispel the <strong>MYTHS</strong>. </p>
	
	<p align="center"><strong><u>FACT</u></strong><br />
      <strong>The public safety pension system safeguards</strong><br />
      <strong>&nbsp;the delivery of vital taxpayer  services.</strong></p>

	<p>For more  than 40 years in Arizona, the traditional public pension system (the Public  Safety Personnel Retirement System) has proven to be a stable, reliable, and  cost-effective method for providing vital taxpayer services. </p>
  <p>Continuing to provide a modest pension &ndash; last  year, the 9,000 PSPRS retirees received an average benefit of $44,000 &ndash; enables  municipal governments to retain and recruit the strong and experienced  workforce they so badly need. A new system could put these vital services at  risk.</p>
  <p><u>It&rsquo;s a <strong>MYTH </strong>that Arizona taxpayers will  benefit from radical reform of the public safety pension system. </u></p>
  <p>Many cities around the state already have a  difficult time attracting and retaining quality public safety employees. A new  pension system of private accounts with lower, unstable retirement income will  further diminish the ability of cities and towns to attract and retain a solid  workforce that serves taxpayers &ndash; especially for high-risk and stressful  positions. </p>
    <p align="center"><strong><u>FACT </u></strong><strong> </strong><br />
      <strong>Taxpayers will pay <u>MORE </u></strong><br />
      <strong>to move to thousands of private accounts. </strong><strong> </strong></p>
  <p>Taxpayers will foot the bill for the high costs to  change from a proven pension system to a radical new system of thousands of  private accounts. Estimates indicate that the costs to shut down the traditional  pension system, set up millions of new private accounts, and educate  participants could cost the state tens of millions of dollars. Where will this  money go? To the same Wall Street fund managers who lost fire fighters&rsquo; and  taxpayers&rsquo; money in the first place.</p>
  <p>Taxpayers also will pay an additional cost for  death and disability pension benefits. These benefits are critical for police,  firefighters and other public safety officers in hazardous occupations. Without  traditional pensions, Arizona will have to pay commercial insurance companies  to set up death and disability plans, or fund the plans itself. Either way,  taxpayers pay more. </p>
  <p><u>It&rsquo;s a <strong>MYTH </strong>that taxpayers will save money  by dismantling the public pension system. </u></p>
  <p>In fact, reforming a tried and true pension system  is a risky gamble<strong>. </strong>Changing to a system of private accounts is like  putting money in the slot machine and hoping to win with three &ldquo;7s.&rdquo; </p>
  <div>
    <p align="center"><strong><u>FACT </u></strong><br />
      <strong>States that have attempted</strong><br />
      <strong>&nbsp;defined contribution reforms of  public pensions have failed.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
  </div>
  <p>States that have experimented  with private accounts as workers&rsquo; primary retirement benefit have found that a  traditional pension plan is a better option. These states recognized that  traditional pension plans are cost-effective, efficient, create value, and help  workers attain a modest, stable retirement. </p>
  <p>For example, West Virginia moved  from a traditional pension plan to private accounts &ndash; and then recently right  back to a traditional plan. Florida, Nebraska, and North Dakota also found that  a new system of private accounts was not a success. </p>
  <div>
    <p align="center"><strong><u>FACT </u></strong><br />
      <strong>Taxpayers will foot the bill for workers who outlive </strong><br />
      <strong>inadequate, unstable retirement income.</strong></p>
  </div>
  <p>We need to learn from the  mistakes of others, rather than repeat their errors. <strong> </strong><br />
    Not everyone has the time, resources,  or experience to be a good investor. Some will win, but most will lose. It is  unreasonable to expect individual investors to outperform the professional  investors who manage traditional pension assets. Under a new system of private  accounts, many workers will find they have lower and inadequate retirement  income. </p>
  <p><u>It&rsquo;s a <strong>MYTH </strong>that private  accounts will generate increased retirement income. </u><br />
    States that experimented with  private accounts saw lower investment returns &ndash; nearly a 50 percent reduction. </p>

  <p>While the public safety pension debate can at times be  complicated, the subject of the Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP)  shouldn&rsquo;t be. DROP helps taxpayers, employers and public safety employees.</p>

 <ul style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 25px;">
    <li>DROP saves taxpayers money by giving  retirees a single, lump sum payout up front in return for diminished retirement  benefits over time. </li>
    <li>DROP allows municipalities to keep  experienced fire fighters and police officers on the job longer and to plan for  future personnel needs.</li>
    <li>DROP gives retirees a much-needed nest  egg as they step into retirement.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before explaining DROP, let&rsquo;s look at the pension of an  &ldquo;average&rdquo; fire fighter with a retirement calculated after a 25-year career and  a final salary of $60,000/year. That fire fighter will receive an annual  pension benefit of 62.5 percent, or $37,500/year. Over 20 years, the total  pension received would be $750,000.</p>
  <p>What happens if that fire fighter works the same quarter  century, but spends the last five years in DROP?</p>
  <p>Upon retirement, this fire fighter will earn a DROP lump sum  payment of $184,000. That sounds huge &ndash; and it will be for the retiree and  their family &ndash; but it also brings with it a long-term savings for taxpayers.</p>
  <p>First, <u>the employer will have not made five years of  pension contributions while the worker is in DROP</u>. That savings? More than  $60,000 at current annual contribution rates. Even more significantly, <u>the  fire fighter who DROPs will receive a decreased 50 percent retirement benefit</u>,  or $30,000/year. Over 20 years, that decrease saves taxpayers $150,000 &ndash; and it  will keep saving taxpayers money every year thereafter.</p>
  <p>While the math sounds confusing, the savings is apparent. <strong>The retiree who enters DROP at 20 years and  retires five years later saves taxpayers $26,000 over 20 years.</strong> At the same  time, the fire fighter is helped into retirement while the employer benefits  from an experienced worker and better planning.</p>
  <p>The myth that DROP is a budget buster is exactly that &ndash; a  myth. DROP changes the timing of benefits paid, paying out retirees less money  from the pension plan they&rsquo;re vested in. Today, approximately 1,900 first  responders in the Public Safety Personnel Retirement System are eligible for  DROP. </p>
  <p>At $26,000 in savings per person, DROP has the potential to  save taxpayers more than $49 million over the next 20 years.</p>
  <p><strong>Budget buster? The facts absolutely say otherwise.</strong></p>
