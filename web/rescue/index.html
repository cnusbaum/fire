<h1>GREEDY? HARDLY.</h1> 
<h3>DON'T LET POLITICIANS GUT PUBLIC SAFETY RETIREMENT</h3>

<p>Arizon's fire fighters and police officers risk their lives and bodies to protect us.</p>
<hr>
<center><span class="callOut">The average annual salary of an Arizona public safety worker? $39,000.</span></center>
<hr>
<p>Public safety retirees rely heavily on the middle-class pensions they were promised when they were hired. <span class="callOut">Unfortunately, some politicians in the Arizona Legislature want to gut these benefits. They've accused fire fighters and police officers of being greedy.</span> The politicians say fire and police are getting rich by robbing taxpayers. That they're pigs at the trough.</p>
<p>Tell that to fire retirees from Gila River, where pensions average $23,959 yearly. Or fire retirees from Pinetop, where pensions average $25,263 per year.</p>

<p>Imagine living off that sum while paying for health insurance that can cost a family upwards of $20,000 each year?</p>

<p>If the legislators get their way, public safety <span class="callOut">retirees will lose the cost of living allowances</span> they depend on to keep their families above water. <span class="callOut">And the average Arizona fire fighter or cop - who's likely already been hit with pay cuts and furlough days - will see another yearly pay cut of about $1,600.</span></p>

<p>If the legislators get their way, these <span class="callOut">retirees will lose the cost of living allowances</span> they depend on to keep their families above water. <span class="callOut">And the average Arizona fire fighter - who's likely already been hit with pay cuts and furlough days - will soon see another yearly pay cut of about $1,600.</span></p>

<p>They rescue us when we dial 911. Who will rescue them?</p>
