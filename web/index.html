<h1>GREEDY? HARDLY.</h1> 
<h3>DON'T LET POLITICIANS GUT FIRE FIGHTERS' RETIREMENTS</h3>

<p>Arizona's fire fighters risk their lives and bodies to protect us. They have lower life expectancies than we do. Upon retirement, they pay sky-high rates for health insurance. And they don't draw Social Security. </p>
<hr>
<center><span class="callOut">The average annual salary of an Arizona fire fighter today? About $39,000.</span></center>
<hr>
<p>Fire fighters and public safety retirees rely heavily on the middle-class pensions they were promised when they were hired. <span class="callOut">Unfortunately, some politicians in the Arizona Legislature want to gut these benefits. They've accused fire fighters and police officers of being greedy</span>. The politicians say fire and police are getting rich by robbing taxpayers. That they're pigs at the trough.</p>

<p>Tell that to fire retirees from Gila River, where pensions average $23,959 yearly.</p>

<p>Tell it to fire retirees from Pinetop, whose pensions average $25,263 per year.</p>

<p>Tell it to fire retirees from Clifton, whose pensions average $28,000 per year.</p>

<p>Imagine living off that pension while paying for health insurance that can cost a family upwards of $20,000 each year?</p>
<hr>
<p>If the legislators get their way, these <span class="callOut">retirees will lose the cost of living allowances</span> they depend on to keep their families above water. <span class="callOut">And the average Arizona fire fighter - who's likely already been hit with pay cuts and furlough days - will soon see another yearly pay cut of about $1,600.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>Fire fighters rescue us when we dial 911. The question is, who will rescue them?</p>

<p>Don't let the politicians get away with attacking on our heroes. Get involved. Call or email your legislator today. <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/alisStaticPages/HowToContactMember.asp" title="How to Contact Member">Click here</a> and let them know what you think: That our heroes deserve what they were promised, not a broken pension and a retirement stuck in poverty.</p>
