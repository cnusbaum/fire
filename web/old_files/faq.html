  <p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions<br /><br /><br /><br />
Every time I open the newspaper, I see public safety workers being painted as  greedy. Are Arizona firefighters and police officers getting rich?</strong></p>
  <p>Absolutely not. The average yearly salary for an Arizona  fire fighter is $39,000, according to careerbuilder.com. With starting pay in  rural areas around $20,000 a year, no one gets into this profession for money,  especially considering the job&rsquo;s physical demands. Last year in Arizona, nearly  9,000 retirees received a PSPRS pension. The average payout? About $44,000.</p><br /><br />
  <p><strong>What about the DROP program I&rsquo;ve heard so much about? Is that a sweetheart  deal?</strong></p>
  <p>No. DROP is a positive program for employees, employers  and taxpayers. It delays the retirement of municipalities&rsquo; most experienced  fire fighters and allows advance planning for personnel needs. DROP provides  savings to taxpayers by reducing lifetime pension payments in return for a  single, lump-sum payment taken from the employee&rsquo;s own retirement account. This  means the employee receives smaller monthly payments for life. DROP creates  additional savings by halting employer pension contributions for each employee  in the plan.</p><br /><br />
  <p><strong>When I retire, I get Social Security. What about fire fighters? Doesn&rsquo;t that  federal program help them?</strong></p>
  <p>Most Arizona fire fighters do not receive Social  Security benefits. Instead, the 7.65 percent tax typically paid by employers is  directed toward fire fighter pension plans as a contribution. Pension critics  rarely mention this fact, skewing their statistics.</p><br /><br />
  <p><strong>The fire fighters I know all seem to retire young. Can&rsquo;t they just go get new  jobs meanwhile collecting their pensions?</strong></p>
  <p>The job&rsquo;s physical demands require fire fighters to  retire at a comparatively young age. Ideally, fire fighters join the force in  their early 20s, retiring after an average of 23 years, in their mid 40s.  Age-appropriate retirement is effective and efficient for taxpayers. It lets  cities staff fire departments with younger, healthier, cheaper fire fighters.  At the same time, because these jobs are so physically demanding, mid-life  career changes are often difficult for former fire fighters. Additionally, the  average fire fighter has a life expectancy 7 to 12 years shorter than you and  I.</p><br /><br />
  <p><strong>But isn&rsquo;t the PSPRS system broke? And isn&rsquo;t it bankrupting the state of  Arizona?</strong></p>
  <p>While PSPRS may be underfunded today, this shortfall  should not be blamed on fire fighters, but on Wall Street and the financial  sector&rsquo;s criminal behavior. Not one fire fighter ever has invested a dime of  the fund&rsquo;s assets. Instead, they&rsquo;ve relied on investment experts hired by the  State of Arizona. Blaming fire fighters for Wall Street&rsquo;s crimes is like  blaming the victims of a fire for the actions of an arsonist.</p>
  <p>Equally important is the fact that today represents a  snapshot in time for PSPRS. Ten years ago, the fund was funded at the 134  percent level (and no one sought to return fire fighters&rsquo; &ldquo;excess&rdquo;  contributions). Given time, the market will reach equilibrium, making the fund  whole again.</p>
